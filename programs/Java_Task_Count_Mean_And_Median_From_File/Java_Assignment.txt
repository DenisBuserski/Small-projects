Task:

Implement a small executable Java application to read in a csv file and process its data by applying different calculations.
Your code should work for different data sets. Two different example data sets are provided (ExampleData_1.csv and ExampleData_2.csv).
Design your application on your preference, but your code should include the following functionality:

1. Read in the content of the csv data file.
2. Parse the content of the csv data file.
3. Process the data and do separate calculations of the mean and the median of the values in column named 'Result'.   
3.1.  (Optionally) Implement the calculation logic in a way, that the user of your classes is able to dynamically add additional calculation types.
4. Output all the result from #3 to standard out (console).
